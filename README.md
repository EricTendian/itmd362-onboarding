# itmd362-onboarding

Project One: Onboarding for ITMD362, Spring 2016. [Project goals and deliverables](http://courses.karlstolley.com/hci/#project-one)

## Project Thesis

Social media sites like Facebook and Google+ have gathered an immense amount of data about how we interact online. Specifically, we have records of almost every conversation conducted on the Internet. Instant messaging (IM) is particularly interesting because it is written communication with no time delay, which makes it a new communication tool.

By analyzing the IM conversations a person has had throughout their digital life, one can build a statistical model of a relationship online. This is useful to the average social media user as they can gain a deeper understanding of how they maintain friendships online. Some statistics:

- number of messages in a given time period (e.g. year)
- percentage of total messages sent/received
- change in message count month-over-month or year-over-year
- average reply time
- and many more

In this onboarding project, I will create a page where people can sign up to be a beta tester of my chat analysis software. This software will calculate many of the statistics above from Facebook chat data. I will need to ensure that users' privacy is honored, and convey that in the onboarding process. By the end of it, users will not necessarily receive the software to beta test, but will be on a waiting list.

Mockups of the process:

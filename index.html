                     <p>Instant messaging (IM) has been around for over a decade, so it is more than technology of the present. It is a record of our past, stored on sites like Facebook and Google. This is a particularly interesting technology because it is written communication with no time delay, which has not existed before in human history.</p>
                     <p>By analyzing the IM conversations a person has had throughout their digital life, one can build a statistical model of a relationship online. This is useful to digital anthropologists and other researchers as they can gain a deeper understanding of how friendships are maintained online.</p>
                     <p><strong>Chatlytics will give researchers and curious social media users the tools to perform such an analysis of this new communication form without costly and complex software.</strong></p>
